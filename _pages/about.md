# About me
I am an **experimentalist** and **data scientist** in rock mechanics and engineering geology. I earned my Ph.D. in rock mechanics under the mentorship of [Prof. Louis Wong](https://www.earthsciences.hku.hk/people/academic_staff/77/?back=af3a6f1ace1fc32210286eb66ab8ef53) from the [Department of Earth Sciences](https://www.earthsciences.hku.hk/) at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) . I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [Rock Physics and Geomaterials Lab](https://rgl.stanford.edu/), working with [Prof. Tiziana Vanorio](https://profiles.stanford.edu/tiziana-vanorio?releaseVersion=10.8.0), at [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/).

**Research Interests:** Rock Mechanics, Acoustic emission, AI4 Rock Engineering, Geothermal, Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)

# Motivation and Vision
My motivation of doing research stems from a deep desire to **advance science** by **making discoveries** and **developing innovative techniques**. I am particularly passionate about the research and technology that have the potential to **foster a more sustainable society** while also promoting **diversity, inclusion and social justice**.

In the future, I aim to leverage my experience and expertise to tackle scientific challenges in rock engineering that contribute to achieving **Net Zero**, such as **enhanced geothermal systems (EGS)** and **nuclear waste geological disposal**, which are closely related to utilizing non-carbon (e.g. geothermal and nuclear) energy, as well as **CO<sub>2</sub> geological storage**

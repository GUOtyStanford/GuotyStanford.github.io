I am an **experimentalist** and **data scientist** in rock mechanics and engineering geology. I earned my Ph.D. in rock mechanics under the mentorship of [Prof. Louis Wong](https://www.earthsciences.hku.hk/people/academic_staff/77/?back=af3a6f1ace1fc32210286eb66ab8ef53) from the [Department of Earth Sciences](https://www.earthsciences.hku.hk/) at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) . I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [Rock Physics and Geomaterials Lab](https://rgl.stanford.edu/), working with [Prof. Tiziana Vanorio](https://profiles.stanford.edu/tiziana-vanorio?releaseVersion=10.8.0), at [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/).
